NB: This readme will be subject to change throughout this releases development

== Main features ==

- Multinetwork support
- SSL Support
- IPV6 Support

- Better error handling
- Addition of Channel.me Channel.notice
- Include a variable on Server for motd (not sure if this is useful yet.)
- Automatic loader for libraries using L_ naming scheme.
- Give deamon mode (so doesn't rely on tmux or screen)
- Make a authentication system (needs design work)
- SSL certificate options
- Configuration Generator
- Better config support (e.g. accept support for older megbot configs, supybot, rbot, eggdrop, inspircd, etc..)
- Add support for common pastebins on the load command (don't do until authentication system works)
- Fix Time
- Switch plugins to use Store library
	* Split Store management into its own thread to save on disk IO

== Using ==

- Make sure you have python 2.6+ installed (could work on lower, won't work on 3.x)
- edit config (to your network)
- Run `python MegBot.py` 

NB: if you would like to run it and close the terminal look into htop or screen
